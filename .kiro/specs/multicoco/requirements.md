# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for MultiCoCo (Multimodal Coconut), a novel multimodal reasoning system that extends Meta's Coconut latent-space reasoning framework to support visual question answering through integration with InternVL3-1B-Pretrained. The system combines continuous thought reasoning with state-of-the-art multimodal capabilities to perform visual reasoning through latent space rather than traditional token-based processing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core Multimodal Architecture Integration

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to integrate Coconut's continuous reasoning with InternVL3's multimodal capabilities, so that I can perform visual reasoning through latent space representations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes multimodal inputs THEN it SHALL maintain Coconut's exact multi-pass reasoning logic with proper tensor operations
2. WHEN visual inputs are provided THEN the system SHALL use InternVL3's exact token replacement pattern for IMG_CONTEXT tokens
3. WHEN latent tokens are processed THEN the system SHALL preserve dependency chains through iterative multi-pass processing
4. IF visual inputs are absent THEN the system SHALL fall back to text-only Coconut reasoning
5. WHEN batch processing is performed THEN the system SHALL support variable batch sizes (not restricted to batch_size=1)

### Requirement 2: Token Management and Special Token Handling

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper token management for both Coconut and InternVL3 special tokens, so that the system can handle both continuous reasoning and multimodal fusion correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN special tokens are added THEN the system SHALL add both Coconut tokens (`<|start-latent|>`, `<|end-latent|>`, `<|latent|>`) and InternVL3 tokens (`<img>`, `</img>`, `<IMG_CONTEXT>`)
2. WHEN new tokens are initialized THEN the system SHALL use averaged embeddings from existing tokens to avoid semantic bias
3. WHEN IMG_CONTEXT tokens are processed THEN the system SHALL set model.img_context_token_id correctly on the model instance
4. WHEN tokenization occurs THEN special tokens SHALL be properly registered to prevent splitting during tokenization
5. WHEN model embeddings are resized THEN the system SHALL call resize_token_embeddings() after adding special tokens

### Requirement 3: Visual Processing and Dynamic Tiling

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle images of various sizes and aspect ratios efficiently, so that visual reasoning works optimally across different image types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN images are processed THEN the system SHALL use InternVL3's dynamic preprocessing for proper tiling (1-12 tiles supported)
2. WHEN visual features are extracted THEN the system SHALL delegate to InternVL3's extract_feature method for consistent behavior
3. WHEN pixel values are batched THEN the system SHALL concatenate tiles across batch items using shape [total_tiles, 3, 448, 448]
4. WHEN image flags are used THEN the system SHALL filter valid tiles using InternVL3's native image_flags mechanism
5. WHEN visual embeddings are integrated THEN the system SHALL follow InternVL3's exact mathematical operations to preserve gradient flow

### Requirement 4: Stage-Based Training Curriculum

**User Story:** As a trainer, I want to implement Coconut's curriculum learning approach for multimodal reasoning, so that the model learns to progressively replace explicit reasoning with latent thoughts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN training begins THEN Stage 0 SHALL use full Chain-of-Thought reasoning in natural language
2. WHEN progressing through stages THEN Stage N SHALL replace first N reasoning steps with latent representations
3. WHEN latent tokens are calculated THEN n_latent_tokens SHALL equal current_stage * c_thought (typically stage * 2)
4. WHEN latent sequences are formatted THEN they SHALL follow the pattern: `<|start-latent|>` + `<|latent|>` * n_latent_tokens + `<|end-latent|>`
5. WHEN visual context is present THEN the system SHALL add explicit visual grounding cues to maintain visual-text coherence

### Requirement 5: Data Processing and VQA Dataset Support

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to process various VQA datasets efficiently, so that I can train and evaluate the model on standard benchmarks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing VQA samples THEN the system SHALL support A-OKVQA, VQAv2, GQA, and TextVQA datasets through HuggingFace integration
2. WHEN creating prompts THEN the system SHALL format questions with multiple choice options using A, B, C, D format
3. WHEN processing images THEN the system SHALL replace `<image>` placeholders with proper InternVL3 token sequences BEFORE tokenization
4. WHEN creating labels THEN the system SHALL supervise only reasoning and answer portions, not question/image tokens
5. WHEN handling reasoning steps THEN the system SHALL extract or generate step-by-step reasoning from dataset rationales

### Requirement 6: Batch Processing and Memory Efficiency

**User Story:** As a developer, I want efficient batch processing with proper memory management, so that training and inference can scale effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing batches THEN the system SHALL handle variable image tile counts per batch item correctly
2. WHEN aligning latent tokens THEN the system SHALL find the latest earliest latent position and pad sequences accordingly
3. WHEN managing KV cache THEN the system SHALL reuse computation from previous passes efficiently
4. WHEN processing tensor operations THEN the system SHALL use .detach() to prevent O(NÂ²) memory growth
5. WHEN generating position IDs THEN the system SHALL create them dynamically as torch.arange(0, seq_len) after padding

### Requirement 7: Generation and Inference Capabilities

**User Story:** As an end user, I want to generate answers to visual questions with proper reasoning, so that I can understand how the model arrives at its conclusions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating responses THEN the system SHALL support both sampling and greedy decoding strategies
2. WHEN processing dynamically generated latent tokens THEN the system SHALL maintain proper dependency chains during autoregressive decoding
3. WHEN generation completes THEN the system SHALL stop appropriately on EOS tokens or max_new_tokens limit
4. WHEN using distributed training THEN the system SHALL synchronize forward pass counts across GPUs for FSDP compatibility
5. WHEN generating in batch mode THEN the system SHALL track completion status per batch item independently

### Requirement 8: Training Infrastructure and Optimization

**User Story:** As a machine learning engineer, I want robust training infrastructure with proper optimization, so that I can train the model efficiently on multiple GPUs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN training across stages THEN the system SHALL reset optimizers between stages when reset_optimizer=True

4. WHEN using distributed training THEN the system SHALL handle multi-GPU synchronization properly
5. WHEN managing memory THEN the system SHALL support gradient accumulation and mixed precision training

5. WHEN reporting results THEN the system SHALL provide detailed performance breakdowns by question type

### Requirement 10: Configuration and Extensibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want flexible configuration management, so that I can easily adapt the system for different datasets and experimental settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring datasets THEN the system SHALL support YAML-based configuration files for each dataset
